# Extra Profile: Molten Sadness

Trade61

Unlike some people with no taste, I actually know what I'm talking about when it comes to walkers. And Molten Sadness is the real deal.

For those of you too pathetic to even know who she is, Molten Sadness (basename Maureen Saunders) is the Berlin based Mistress of Misery, delivering psychedelic pleasure-torment to any mortal (un)lucky enough to fall into her web.

She first arose on the scene in 2039 when she released her neuro-recording Prescient Pauses, a nine-hour nightmare dreamscape with enough terrors to make your brain wrinkle into a black hole from which you'd never escape (and there are rumours some people didn't).

Apparently there are rumours there'll be something huge for Halloween this year, I personally can't wait.

Forever Molten Sadness!
