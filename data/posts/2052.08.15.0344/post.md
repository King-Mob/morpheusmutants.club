# The art of Neuro-Resonant Recordings

T7H04

The basis of a neuro-resonant recording is the subjective experience of the dream. The basis of art is to transmit a subjective experience to the perceiver. 

The act of recording is purely observational. It is scientific. It is empiricism in its purest form. 

So the NRR exists at the intersection of art and science. We get to truly experience the dream-experience of another human being. Yes, of course, this is filtered through our own subjectivity. What does that image mean to me? This begs the question: is there ever true Empiricism? Despite it being the basis of our whole society, empiricism isn’t actually accessible outside of scientific theory. Perhaps our consciousness itself, segmented as it is between each individual being, makes it impossible to truly find ‘truth’. Nevertheless, in a world where art has become manufactured and designed to the extent where we’re unsure if we’re experiencing an actual creative exploration of the world or the result of a meeting between a bunch of marketeers and machines, this format is a breath of fresh air. It allows us to ‘tune in and drop out’.
