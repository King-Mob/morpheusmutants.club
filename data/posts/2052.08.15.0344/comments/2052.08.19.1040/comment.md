Yes, I certainly enjoy this form as much as you my friend. If there was to be anything I would add to your analysis it would be a question: As dichotomies break down in our reality, is the subject/object dualism the last to go? It would seem we are holding tight to this one, but we must let go. This is a thought that occurred to me, once, when I ‘tuned in and dropped out’. There may have been NRRs and ‘substances’ involved.
