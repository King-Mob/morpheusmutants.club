# Proven theory

I already knew that Alien Brainstorm was on the team -in fact I’d consider it pretty much 100% proven. 
That’s because I have seen documentation showing that he presented at a University of Manchester research tech demo in March ‘3 (under his basename of course). 
He also co-authored a paper with someone called Tristan Grass that they presented at a symposium attached to the event. 
Most AB fans know this, but few have actually seen the paper. I have. It’s an early outline of the potential for dream resonation in the context of the project they were working on but also broader applications in therapeutic practice. 
Weirdly, it wasn’t picked up publicly, probably because it was too whacky for the academy and too philosophical/ not practical enough for the tech industry. After that, the trail goes cold for a while until the release of EasiDreem1. 
My guess as to what happened? Someone with money in DID get hold of the early research and hushed it up, investing in the team to get to the point of being able to produce the EasiDreem 1. 

Oh, and I agree with you about the Infinity… that thing was truly the worst. If AB was involved, he sure as hell didn’t make that one!
