It's obvious that AB was part of the dev team because you can see in his 5th neuro-recording the early logo for easidreem. I'd consider it common knowledge. 

Going even further back than that, we can pretty much say without at doubt that he was an essential part of the resi dev. Going as far back as 2039 in fact. 'Techniques of Neural Resonation' (2037, Branston, Grass). It was co-authored with his colleague Tristan Grass and presented at neurology conference. Most AB fans know this, but few have actually seen the paper. I have. It’s an early outline of the potential for dream resonation in the context of the project they were working on but also broader applications in therapeutic practice. Weirdly, it wasn’t picked up publicly, probably because it was too whacky for the academy and too philosophical/ not practical enough for the tech industry. After that, the trail goes cold for a while until the release of EasiDreem1. 
My guess as to what happened? Someone with money DID get hold of the early research and hushed it up, investing in the team to get to the point of being able to produce the EasiDreem 1. 

Oh, and I agree with you about the Infinity… that thing was truly the worst. If AB was involved, he sure as hell didn’t make that one!
