# Did AB design the EasiDreem1?

KingDavidTheThird

Thought I’d put together a little post about the original resonators that got this hobby started because I’m not seeing a lot of info about resis on this board. Plus I've got a little theory I wanted to share!

First of all this is an appreciation post for the EasiDreem1, haha. Sure, it was clunky and glitchy and it made a hell of a lot of noise… but you could FEEL the resonation. Hell you could hear it and smell it too! But it worked so goddam well when you got the hang of it. It’s such a shame that it was followed by the EasiDreem Infinity (the WORST resi of all time!) The EasiDreem1 was  nowhere near as slick as the resonators that big-name consumer brands put out now, but it was a true piece of human ingenuity and technological wizardry. There was something… magical about it. 

If you used it, you're going to know exaclty what I mean when I mention the floating paper. If you didn't, let me explain.
The first time you used the Easidreem1, it required a setup period where it took a copy of your neuropattern to connect you properly with the hub. So you'd put it on, get drowsy and fall asleep. Then, you'd dream your dream and the Easidreem would kick in taking your neuro pattern. You'd start to see these thin slips of paper floating around in your dream. You could catch them and read what they said, they always had these cool dream-related phrases on them. Poems and quotes and stuff. The one I will always remember seeing in mine was “A dream within a dream is like an ocean reflected in a dew drop”. 

So, onto the Brainstorm connection. I know the EasiDreem team was super secret, but I think this easily proves AB worked on it. I was rewatching some of his neuro recordings last night and one of my old faves, #109 (Water Vapour in Spring) came on. It’s such a total classic and I was glad to see it after so long because it’s a rare recording that’s not action packed, pretty serene. For anyone who’s been compos somnium, you’ll know it’s INCREDIBLY difficult to maintain a strong resonance with a dream this relaxing and slow-paced. It really does prove he’s a master.

There’s this moment where Brainstorm’s slowly walking down a huge, misty path lined with cherry blossom trees in full bloom and he stops and says

_As the dew appears_

_As the dew disappears_

_Such is my life, that Naniwa_

_Is a dream within a dream_

Remind you of anything? I doubt it’s simply a reference to the loading screen of the EasiDreem1. It’s way more likely that this is an example that Alien Brainstorm’s fingerprints are all over the original design.
