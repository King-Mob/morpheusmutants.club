# Did AB design the EasiDreem1?

KingDavidTheThird

Thought I’d put together a little post about the original resonators that got this hobby started because I’m not seeing a lot of info about resis on this board. Plus I've got a little theory I wanted to share!

First of all this is an appreciation post for the EasiDreem1, haha. Sure, it was clunky and glitchy and it made a hell of a lot of noise… but you could FEEL the resonation. Hell you could hear it and smell it too! But it worked so goddam well when you got the hang of it. It’s such a shame that it was followed by the EasiDreem Infinity (the WORST resi of all time!) The EasiDreem1 was  nowhere near as slick as the resonators that big-name consumer brands put out now, but it was a true piece of human ingenuity and technological wizardry. There was something… magical about it. 

It took a hell of a long time to load. I remember thinking… What happens if I fall asleep while this thing is booting up? Is that safe? (haha!) Anyways, on the loading page were these slogans that would float around on pieces of paper in the air and you could catch them and read them. There were a few little slogans but one of them was “‘A dream within a dream is like an ocean reflected in a dew drop”. 

So, onto the Brainstorm connection. I was rewatching some of his neuro recordings last night and one of my old faves, #109 (Water Vapour in Spring) came on. It’s such a total classic and I was glad to see it after so long because it’s a rare recording that’s not action packed, pretty serene. For anyone who’s been compos somnium, you’ll know it’s INCREDIBLY difficult to maintain a strong resonance with a dream this relaxing and slow-paced. It really does prove he’s a master.

There’s this moment where Brainstorm’s slowly walking down a huge, misty path lined with cherry blossom trees in full bloom and he stops and says

_As the dew appears_

_As the dew disappears_

_Such is my life, that Naniwa_

_Is a dream within a dream_

Remind you of anything? I doubt it’s simply a reference to the loading screen of the EasiDreem1. It’s way more likely that this is an example that Alien Brainstorm’s fingerprints are all over the original design.
