# resi spares for repairs

Hi all! 

I'm after a few bits and bobs for my machine. She's not working at the moment as the REM Monitor is totally fried - thought it was a common bug affecting the brainwave matrix but it seems to be the hardware that's packed in. Was wondering why i had been experiencing post-session muscle paralisis... So a new REM Monitor is definitly on my shopping list as an esential if anyone can help?

Would also be nice to have a few replacement Oscillating Signal Coils as mine are almost burned out from general wear and tear. Of course it's not likely I'd be able to replace the entire Reverb Manifold but if there were any other components to enhance that or the Signal Processing Unit I would happily discuss a fair price. 

Peace.
