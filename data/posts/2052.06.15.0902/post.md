Stop Spamming

If we’re going to have a fandom that functions well and leaves space for everyone to express their views, we can’t just have all the posts about one person. He’s top of the pile, the favourite , the most prolific - sure. But  spamming with Alien Brainstorm content is just so goddam boring.  
Ask yourself this question. Is this a fan site for dreamwalkers  or for Dr Alien Brainstorm?
