Hello dreamwalker fan community!

I’m an artist working on some pieces inspired by neuro-resonant recordings, using found-sounds that I’ve come across in dreams, as well as classic recordings that I just really enjoyed and seemed to fit together. I’ve compiled some of my work [here](neuroresonantimages.com) and would love to hear what you think.

I have been deeply moved by dream images since I was a child. Once I started dreamwalking, this became the sole focus of my artistic practice. Using art, I seek to find a way to harmonise my own personal dreamworld with the shared dream-space that has emerged since the invention of the neural resonator. I hope my work can shed light on both our shared sense of self through dreaming, as well as my own rich inner world. This is no easy task, and I’d welcome comments from people who have experience with watching neuro-resonant recordings. I personally have an exceedingly large collection of NRR’s - some of them are pretty rare. I’m sure there are some true fans of the genre on this site so would love to share in this passion!

My work is by no means complete. I have several other neuro-resonant recordings in my collection that I’d like to explore through art. If any other artists on here wish to collaborate, please get in touch.

Thank you.
