# Hello dreamwalker fan community!

I’m an artist working on some pieces inspired by neuro-resonant recordings, using found-sounds that I’ve come across in dreams, as well as classic recordings that I just really enjoyed and seemed to fit together. I wondered if there are any others out there who want to explore similar themes? Im really inspire by LadyYyesodica's work - I know most of you probably buy from her Imaginarium, but you should definitely [check out her creative work](https://ladyyyesodica.netlify.app) , especially if you vibe with her dreampunk gnosticism.

I have been deeply moved by dream images since I was a child. Once I started interdreaming, this became the sole focus of my artistic practice. Using art, I seek to find a way to harmonise my own personal dreamworld with the shared dream-space that has emerged since the invention of the neural resonator. Art inspired by resi culture can shed light on both our shared sense of self through dreaming, as well as our own rich inner worlds. This is no easy task, and I’d welcome comments from people who have experience with watching neuro-resonant recordings as to how best to go about this. I'd like to do something like LadyYyesodica but with my own twist. I personally have an exceedingly large collection of NRR’s - some of them are pretty rare, so i've got plenty of inspiration. I’m sure there are some true fans of the genre on this site so would love to share in this passion!

##I have several other neuro-resonant recordings in my collection that I’d like to explore through art. If any other artists on here wish to collaborate, please get in touch.

Thank you.
