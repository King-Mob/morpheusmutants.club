Love the way you used language to explore the crystal cathedral dream image. It was a beautiful take on the way that neuro-resi recording movesâ€¦ thanks! I feel like Iâ€™m there even though my resi be broke right now. Seeking parts if anyoneâ€™s interested â€¦ ðŸ¤­

Hmmm youâ€™ve definitely captured the essence of some of them. There must be neuro-recordings in your collection that Iâ€™ve not heard of though??? Because I donâ€™t recognise some of them.
