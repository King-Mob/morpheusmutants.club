YESSS I'm a huge LadyYyesodica fan! Love the way she uses language to explore the crystal cathedral dream image. It was a beautiful take on the way that neuro-resi recording moves! I feel like I’m there even though my resi be broke right now. Seeking parts if anyone’s interested … 🤭

Hmmm it's hard to capture the essence of a dream in a piece of art, I don't know how she does it. I'm not an artist myself. Maybe look into taking a course or something but i know they can be pretty bullshi and expensive.
