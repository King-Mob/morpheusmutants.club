I always wondered where LadyYyesodica was getting these recordings from - how do you aquire your private collection? Very interesting idea to make art out of them. Yesodica has taken a LOT of artistic license, or shes got access to recordings that are pretty rare? 
In terms of these sorts of sites and the art itself - OK i guess. It would be good to see someone go a bit further and add more to let the feel of the NNRs shine through, rather than whatever weird philosophy Lady Y is espousing... Part of me wonders though, what’s the point? If you want to experience an NRR then get a resonator, mod it, buy the recordings and set sail.
