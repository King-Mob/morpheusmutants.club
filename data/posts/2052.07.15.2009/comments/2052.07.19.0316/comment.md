Where you getting these recordings from? Very interesting. Either you’ve taken a LOT of artistic license, or you’ve got access to recordings that are pretty rare? 
In terms of the actual site and art itself - OK i guess. You could definitely add more to let the feel of the NNRs shine through. Part of me wonders though, what’s the point? If you want to experience an NRR then get a resonator, mod it, buy the recordings and set sail.
