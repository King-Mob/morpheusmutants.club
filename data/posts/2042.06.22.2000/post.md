I HAVE to put forward the incredible Golden Cascade for consideration.

*_GOLDEN CASCADE_*
basename: Gordon Cresswell

Founder of the Dream Ecstacy Alliance - the pursuers of dream pleasure!!! Some have accused Goldy of being naive in the face of the unconscious. Some critics have said he is dancing a dangerous dance in the face of evil. I'd say that's a load of bullshit. There's no rules in the dream realm, just fantasy. He's my fantasy. Just take one look at this GOLDEN APOLLO and you'll realise pleasure is central to ALL DREAMS! When someone asks me 'what's your dream?' I answer - Golden Cascade!!!

He really changed the game with his unique focus and I honestly think anyone on this site would be hard pressed to deny that. Even if you don't like his style, you've got to admit.... he's GORGEOUS!
