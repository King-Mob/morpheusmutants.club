# ðŸ“ŒWelcome to Morpheus Mutants Club PLUS Ground Rules

Pipe_draiN

Greetings fellow fans of the dreamway. Some of you will be familiar with me under a variety of different names, from previous incarnations of our many-times scattered community. Perhaps in time I shall share with you some of those previous names.

After our last scattering, from a site whose name we all know, I had a private conversation with a couple of deeply trusted allies where we shared our frustration with this constant cycle of dream walking fan sites being created, taken over by wannabe walkers and then shut down by the IRO. One of our allies, ShuxWana, jokingly suggested that we should start our own site, with automatic removal of anything that could get it shut down by the IRO. That joke started to become more and more serious until we actually decided to make it.

Welcome to Morpheus Mutants Club.

## Ground Rules

Morpheus Mutants Club is for FANS of dream walkers to discuss the exploits of our favourite onerionauts and share theories about the secret history of this fascinating practice.

MMC is NOT a forum to discuss HOW to become a dream walker, WHERE to access controlled equipment and especially not SHARING LINKS to documents that have been EXPLCITLY RESTRICTED by the Interdreaming Regulation Office. That's what got <WORD AUTOMATICALLY REMOVED> shut down last month.

Ah yes, thanks to our lovely admin, who has requested not to be named in this post, any mention of previously deleted site names will be replaced with <WORD AUTOMATICALLY REMOVED>, along with any links to sites that clearly violate IRO restrictions.

Other than avoiding wannabe chatter, ShuxWana and myself also request that we treat our fellow mutants with respect and generosity at all times. If someone talks about a walker that you're not a fan of, it's not that important to let everyone know that. Just move on and post about your own favourites.

Other than that, I now declare registration and posting for Morpheus Mutants Club open! I can't wait to catch up with you all
