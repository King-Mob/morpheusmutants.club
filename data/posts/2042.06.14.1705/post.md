# Alien Brainstorm is the Best

ShuxWana

I think sometimes we get too caught up trying to catalogue the newer walkers that we forget to respect the original and the best, so here is my tribute to the one and only: Alien Brainstorm

Alien Brainstorm (basename: Alan Branston) is STILL for my money the most elite of all the dreamwalkers. His exploits are legendary for a reason.

His resonator is too cute and he just pulls it out of the bag every time.

Go Brainstorm!
