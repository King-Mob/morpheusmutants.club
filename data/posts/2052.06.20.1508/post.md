Since people are sharing their favourite walkers I thought I'd have a go at approaching this pretty mega topic. This is one for the weird kids! Recently Iâ€™ve been getting into dreamphysics so if people are interested in my tiny take, I can post again at some point and get into the details of what I know.

_Siblings of the Eternal Loadstone_
Basenames unknown but it's generally agreed among fans that there are about 9 of them and that the coven founder is Magma Rising Stone (basename Magda Robertson).

This group of bizarre dreamwalkers assemble around celestial dream objects such as stars, planets and satellites. Believing that these transient objects have 'dream fields' and in the concept of 'dreamspacetime' (that's one for another post) they essentially worship in a way that seeks to manipulate a phenomena that could best be likened to irl electromagnetism. That's called 'dream charge'.

Now clearly there's no actual evidence for this stuff at all, it's more than likely made up. Not to mention that dreamphysics is spooky stuff. The only reason we know about this is from a _legendary post_ that showed up about a year ago by an anonymous dreamer purporting to have taken part in one of these worshipping events. Conspiracy theories abound in this area and I'm not one to say what's true or false. In the dreamsphere people can say and do whatever they want as far as I'm concerned.

I personally think it's cool how the study of dream physics became something so weird and wonderful. In the grand scheme of things that happened pretty quickly? If it was like 2042 when the resonators took off, then it's mad that by 2040 there is basically evidence of a religion ...or at least a cult - comment which one you think it is!
