If you feel that way then maybe you should be lurking somewhere that's more for active resi modders, rather than a literal FAN site? This is a communtiy for people who admire dreamwalkers of all different types. Everyone is welcome here. If you've got a problem with that then you need to look elsewhere, I'm afraid.
