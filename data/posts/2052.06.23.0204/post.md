# DREAM ECSTACY ALLIANCE SCAM

user1009

There's only so much bullshit I can take. Seeing people celebrating on here about some of the classic dreamwalkers was cute, but I'm not going to quietly stand by while people fawn over sickos like Golden Cascade and his crew of demented perverts. Unlike some people here I actually have a lot of experience with modding resis and getting compos somnium.

Maybe I should start at the beginning.

Been a big dreamer since I was a kid and I always pulled on that thread. I dropped out of school and got into resi mods a couple of years ago. I tried one of those EasiDreem free trials and (even thoug it was totally shit) I knew it was something I wanted to really get into. I didn't want to just sit around watching neuro-recordings in my room anymore. I wanted to be part of it. So I got job, grafted hard and took the plunge to get a proper resonator.

It was right after I got my first resi from <LINK AUTOMATICALLY REMOVED> that I was contacted by someone at the Dream Ecstacy Alliance. It looked cool, you know, very glossy and cute. They told me if I joined I'd be able to access their databases and that they'd give me at least 5 1-1 checkins with their 'ecstacy rep' every year. Then there was the guide books and stuff that they'd provide with a membership, it seemed legit. I thought it seemed like something that could help me break through. Maybe I'd be able to learn a thing or two, maybe make some pals and get CS fast.

I was wrong.

The first red flag was the 'membership fee'. In order to even pay the upfront cost of joining, I had to purchase upwards of Â£700 worth of their currency (pleasurecoin) in order to pay the 'start up fee'. The coins are pretty much worthless outside of purchasing the membership fees for DEA. My hard earned cash pissed away. Not only that, but I was expected to recruit other dreamers in order to keep progressing.

The representative from Dream Ecstacy Alliance really pulled out all the stops to make my first experience with them memorable. I'll admit, it did make me feel excited by all the cool stuff I could do with my resi. But it was only just the first dream that actually had any depth to it. The rest was just a moneymaking scheme. Bland, glitchy and pretty much undreamable experiences. The 'guidlines' they promised? Copied and pasted from sites like this. The 'checkins' they promised? Limited and amateur at best, downright dangerous at worst.

Then, the sex stuff. I mean... I get it? I guess? I knew it was something people were into, but it seemed like it's ALL they were into. It's in the name - ecstacy. I just don't understand why people wouldn't try and get pleasure from all the other cool stuff that dreams have to offer. Some people are so driven by their physical bodies that even when they're dreaming they're slaves to desires. I'm not going to go into details about what they did to me here. All i'll say is that it changed the way i see this community.

I could go on, but I don't want to give this sickening waste of time and money any more attention than they're already getting on here. Let's just hope whoever's reading this isn't paying these sex freaks their hard earned cash.

What people do in their own dreams is totally fine, we all have sexual urges and needs. But don't try and make money out of it or force people to do things they don't want to do.
