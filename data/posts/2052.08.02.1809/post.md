Protect our fandom

 Blatantly_Speshul

We really can’t have people mentioning modding resonators on here. It’s as simple as that. As much as I love this community I can’t understand why it always ends up going the same way. Is this just humanity? Is it the time of life? Whatever the answer to these big questions I come here once again asking, nay begging, for you to please protect our dreamwalker fandom community. This is real, guys. This is the law, the authorities… wake up to the REAL WORLD!
