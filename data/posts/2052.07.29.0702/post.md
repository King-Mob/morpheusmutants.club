# EMERGENCY ADVICE NEEDED

REMster

Guys i've been up all night trying to solve a really serious issue with my friend, posting here in the hope that someone can help.

Everything was going ok for the first hour of our session but then my pal just started glitching out. I thought it was part of the dream at first? But it turns out he's stuck in a false wake cycle. I've been following some guides i found online but literally none of it's working. I don't know if i'm just being a noob or if there's actually something wrong with the hardware at this point, either way i don't really like the idea of my friend's brain being scrambled long-term because I couldn't get the bug fixed in time. Anyone got any suggestions?
