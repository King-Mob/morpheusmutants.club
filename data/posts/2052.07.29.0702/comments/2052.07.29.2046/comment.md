That’s not true, Trade. There’s compassion here, just no tolerance for this kind of post. But if anything this just shows how dangerous the hobby can be.

I hope everything works out. I don't know anything about this kind of thing really, and I doubt anyone else here does as this is a fan site only? If you need to hire a professional then of course there's DR AB but I mean from what I've read you would need to act fast for FWC because allegedly they are super dangerous.

Good luck.
