His exploits are legendary for a reason.\r\rHis resonator is too cute and he just pulls it out of the bag every time.\r\rGo Brainstorm!\r","comments":{"2042.06.14.1805":{"title":"That's dumb","user":"Trade61","body":"You only like him because you haven't heard of any others. And Branston is such a lame basename\r"},"2042.06.14.1836":{"title":"You're dumb","user":"ShuxWana","body":"Why don't you post about your fav walker instead of dumping on everybody else's (which is Brainstorm by the way üòú)\r"},"2042.06.14.1903":{"title":"Dumbness is in the eye of the beholder","user":"Trade61","body":"I've got a post queued up now about mine, just watch...\r"}}},"2042.06.15.0214":{"title":"Extra Profile: Molten Sadness","user":"Trade61","body":"Unlike some people with no taste, I actually know what I'm talking about when it comes to walkers. And Molten Sadness is the real deal.\r\rFor those of you too pathetic to even know who she is, Molten Sadness (basename Maureen Saunders) is the Berlin based Mistress of Misery, delivering psychedelic pleasure-torment to any mortal (un)lucky enough to fall into her web.\r\rShe first arose on the scene in 2039 when she released her neuro-recording Prescient Pauses, a nine-hour nightmare dreamscape with enough terrors to make your brain wrinkle into a black hole from which you'd never escape (and there are rumours some people didn't).\r\rApparently there are rumours there'll be something huge for Halloween this year, I personally can't wait.\r\rForever Molten Sadness!\r","comments":{"2042.06.15.0743":{"title":"Not for me","user":"HydeNSikh","body":"She creeps me out dude\r"},"2042.16.15.0948":{"title":"This is who you like?","user":"ShuxWana","body":"God, I remember that neuro-recording.
