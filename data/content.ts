His exploits are legendary for a reason.\r\n\r\nHis resonator is too cute and he just pulls it out of the bag every time.\r\n\r\nGo Brainstorm!\r\n","comments":{"2042.06.14.1805":{"title":"That's dumb","user":"Trade61","body":"You only like him because you haven't heard of any others. And Branston is such a lame basename\r\n"},"2042.06.14.1836":{"title":"You're dumb","user":"ShuxWana","body":"Why don't you post about your fav walker instead of dumping on everybody else's (which is Brainstorm by the way üòú)\r\n"},"2042.06.14.1903":{"title":"Dumbness is in the eye of the beholder","user":"Trade61","body":"I've got a post queued up now about mine, just watch...\r\n"}}},"2042.06.15.0214":{"title":"Extra Profile: Molten Sadness","user":"Trade61","body":"Unlike some people with no taste, I actually know what I'm talking about when it comes to walkers. And Molten Sadness is the real deal.\r\n\r\nFor those of you too pathetic to even know who she is, Molten Sadness (basename Maureen Saunders) is the Berlin based Mistress of Misery, delivering psychedelic pleasure-torment to any mortal (un)lucky enough to fall into her web.\r\n\r\nShe first arose on the scene in 2039 when she released her neuro-recording Prescient Pauses, a nine-hour nightmare dreamscape with enough terrors to make your brain wrinkle into a black hole from which you'd never escape (and there are rumours some people didn't).\r\n\r\nApparently there are rumours there'll be something huge for Halloween this year, I personally can't wait.\r\n\r\nForever Molten Sadness!\r\n","comments":{"2042.06.15.0743":{"title":"Not for me","user":"HydeNSikh","body":"She creeps me out dude\r\n"},"2042.16.15.0948":{"title":"This is who you like?","user":"ShuxWana","body":"God, I remember that neuro-recording.

This is one for the weird kids! Recently I‚Äôve been getting into dreamphysics so if people are interested in my tiny take, I can post again at some point and get into the details of what I know.\r\n\r\n_Siblings of the Eternal Loadstone_\r\nBasenames unknown but it's generally agreed among fans that there are about 9 of them and that the coven founder is Magnet Rising Stone (basename Martha Robertson).\r\n\r\nThis group of bizarre dreamwalkers assemble around celestial dream objects such as stars, planets and satellites. Believing that these transient objects have 'dream fields' and in the concept of 'dreamspacetime' (that's one for another post) they essentially worship in a way that seeks to manipulate a phenomena that could best be likened to irl electromagnetism. That's called 'dream charge'.\r\n\r\nNow clearly there's no actual evidence for this stuff at all, it's more than likely made up. Not to mention that dreamphysics is spooky stuff. The only reason we know about this is from a _legendary post_ that showed up about a year ago by an anonymous dreamer purporting to have taken part in one of these worshipping events. Conspiracy theories abound in this area and I'm not one to say what's true or false. In the dreamsphere people can say and do whatever they want as far as I'm concerned.\r\n\r\nI personally think it's cool how the study of dream physics became something so weird and wonderful. In the grand scheme of things that happened pretty quickly? If it was like 2032 when the resonators took off, then it's mad that by 2040 there is basically evidence of a religion ...or at least a cult - comment which one you think it is!\r\n","comments":{"2042.06.20.1520":{"title":"No doubt in my mind!","user":"resibomb","body":"Definitely a cult. I mean last I heard the siblings were saying they‚Äôve found a way to break into hyperspace through the manipulation of dream charge? That‚Äôs pretty whacky stuff if you ask me. There‚Äôs clearly some psychological manipulation happening by Magnet Rising Stone.\r\n"},"2042.06.20.1559":{"title":"Steer clear","user":"TheSetiYeti","body":"Yeah I agree it‚Äôs totally a cult! For any history buffs out there it sort of reminds me of those old stories about Theta particles and Starseeds and stuff. I‚Äôd stay well clear of them if I had a resi.\r\n"},"2042.06.20.1803":{"title":"Urgh I don't get it","user":"Trade61","body":"Seriously?
