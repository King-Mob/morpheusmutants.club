His exploits are legendary for a reason.\r\n\r\nHis resonator is too cute and he just pulls it out of the bag every time.\r\n\r\nGo Brainstorm!\r\n","comments":{"2042.06.14.1805":{"title":"That's dumb","user":"Trade61","body":"You only like him because you haven't heard of any others. And Branston is such a lame basename\n"},"2042.06.14.1836":{"title":"You're dumb","user":"ShuxWana","body":"Why don't you post about your fav walker instead of dumping on everybody else's (which is Brainstorm by the way 😜)\n"},"2042.06.14.1903":{"title":"Dumbness is in the eye of the beholder","user":"Trade61","body":"I've got a post queued up now about mine, just watch...\n"}}},"2042.06.15.0214":{"title":"Extra Profile: Molten Sadness","user":"Trade61","body":"Unlike some people with no taste, I actually know what I'm talking about when it comes to walkers. And Molten Sadness is the real deal.\n\nFor those of you too pathetic to even know who she is, Molten Sadness (basename Maureen Saunders) is the Berlin based Mistress of Misery, delivering psychedelic pleasure-torment to any mortal (un)lucky enough to fall into her web.\n\nShe first arose on the scene in 2039 when she released her neuro-recording Prescient Pauses, a nine-hour nightmare dreamscape with enough terrors to make your brain wrinkle into a black hole from which you'd never escape (and there are rumours some people didn't).\n\nApparently there are rumours there'll be something huge for Halloween this year, I personally can't wait.\n\nForever Molten Sadness!\n","comments":{"2042.06.15.0743":{"title":"Not for me","user":"HydeNSikh","body":"She creeps me out dude\n"},"2042.16.15.0948":{"title":"This is who you like?","user":"ShuxWana","body":"God, I remember that neuro-recording.

This is one for the weird kids! Recently I’ve been getting into dreamphysics so if people are interested in my tiny take, I can post again at some point and get into the details of what I know.\r\n\r\n_Siblings of the Eternal Loadstone_\r\nBasenames unknown but it's generally agreed among fans that there are about 9 of them and that the coven founder is Magnet Rising Stone (basename Martha Robertson).\r\n\r\nThis group of bizarre dreamwalkers assemble around celestial dream objects such as stars, planets and satellites. Believing that these transient objects have 'dream fields' and in the concept of 'dreamspacetime' (that's one for another post) they essentially worship in a way that seeks to manipulate a phenomena that could best be likened to irl electromagnetism. That's called 'dream charge'.\r\n\r\nNow clearly there's no actual evidence for this stuff at all, it's more than likely made up. Not to mention that dreamphysics is spooky stuff. The only reason we know about this is from a _legendary post_ that showed up about a year ago by an anonymous dreamer purporting to have taken part in one of these worshipping events. Conspiracy theories abound in this area and I'm not one to say what's true or false. In the dreamsphere people can say and do whatever they want as far as I'm concerned.\r\n\r\nI personally think it's cool how the study of dream physics became something so weird and wonderful. In the grand scheme of things that happened pretty quickly? If it was like 2032 when the resonators took off, then it's mad that by 2040 there is basically evidence of a religion ...or at least a cult - comment which one you think it is!\r\n","comments":{"2042.06.20.1520":{"title":"No doubt in my mind!","user":"resibomb","body":"Definitely a cult. I mean last I heard the siblings were saying they’ve found a way to break into hyperspace through the manipulation of dream charge? That’s pretty whacky stuff if you ask me. There’s clearly some psychological manipulation happening by Magnet Rising Stone.\r\n"},"2042.06.20.1559":{"title":"Steer clear","user":"TheSetiYeti","body":"Yeah I agree it’s totally a cult! For any history buffs out there it sort of reminds me of those old stories about Theta particles and Starseeds and stuff. I’d stay well clear of them if I had a resi.\r\n"},"2042.06.20.1803":{"title":"Urgh I don't get it","user":"Trade61","body":"Seriously? If this is the sort of stuff that's going to be discussed on here, you can count me out.\r\n"}}},"2042.06.22.2000":{"title":"Don't forget our Golden Boy!!!","user":"99electricsheep","body":"Loving these appreciation posts so far <3 love this community <3 love dreaming!!!!\r\n\r\nI HAVE to put forward the incredible Golden Cascade for consideration.\r\n\r\n*_GOLDEN CASCADE_*\r\nbasename: Gordon Cresswell\r\n\r\nFounder of the Dream Ecstacy Alliance - the pursuers of dream pleasure!!! Some have accused Goldy of being naive in the face of the unconscious. Some critics have said he is dancing a dangerous dance in the face of evil. I'd say that's a load of bullshit. There's no rules in the dream realm, just fantasy. He's my fantasy. Just take one look at this GOLDEN APOLLO and you'll realise pleasure is central to ALL DREAMS! When someone asks me 'what's your dream?' I answer - Golden Cascade!!!\r\n\r\nHe really changed the game with his unique focus and I honestly think anyone on this site would be hard pressed to deny that. Even if you don't like his style, you've got to admit.... he's GORGEOUS! \r\n","comments":{"2042.06.22.2001":{"title":"...","user":"Trade61","body":"I'm gonna hurl"}}},"2042.06.23.0200":{"title":"DREAM ECSTACY ALLIANCE SCAM","user":"user1009","body":"There's only so much bullshit I can take. Seeing people celebrating on here about some of the classic dreamwalkers was cute, but I'm not going to quietly stand by while people fawn over sickos like Golden Cascade and his crew of demented perverts. Unlike some people here I actually have a lot of experience with modding resis and getting compos somnium.\r\n\r\nMaybe I should start at the beginning. \r\n\r\nBeen a big dreamer since I was a kid and I always pulled on that thread. I dropped out of school and got into resi mods a couple of years ago. I tried InterDream's free trial and (even thoug it was totally shit) I knew it was something I wanted to really get into. I didn't want to just sit around watching neuro-recordings in my room anymore. I wanted to be part of it. So I got job, grafted hard and took the plunge to get a proper resonator.\r\n\r\nIt was right after I got my first resi that I was contacted by someone at the Dream Ecstacy Alliance. It looked cool, you know, very glossy and cute. They told me if I joined I'd be able to access their databases and that they'd give me at least 5 1-1 checkins with their 'ecstacy rep' every year. Then there was the guide books and stuff that they'd provide with a membership, it seemed legit. I thought it seemed like something that could help me break through. Maybe I'd be able to learn a thing or two, maybe make some pals and get CS fast.\r\n\r\nI was wrong.\r\n\r\nThe first red flag was the 'membership fee'. In order to even pay the upfront cost of joining, I had to purchase upwards of £700 worth of their currency (pleasurecoin) in order to pay the 'start up fee'. The coins are pretty much worthless outside of purchasing the membership fees for DEA. My hard earned cash pissed away. Not only that, but I was expected to recruit other dreamers in order to keep progressing. \r\n\r\nThe representative from Dream Ecstacy Alliance really pulled out all the stops to make my first experience with them memorable. I'll admit, it did make me feel excited by all the cool stuff I could do with my resi. But it was only just the first dream that actually had any depth to it. The rest was just a moneymaking scheme. Bland, glitchy and pretty much undreamable experiences. The 'guidlines' they promised? Copied and pasted from sites like this. The 'checkins' they promised? Limited and amateur at best, downright dangerous at worst.\r\n\r\nThen, the sex stuff. I mean... I get it? I guess? I knew it was something people were into, but it seemed like it's ALL they were into. It's in the name - ecstacy. I just don't understand why people wouldn't try and get pleasure from all the other cool stuff that dreams have to offer. Some people are so driven by their physical bodies that even when they're dreaming they're slaves to desires. I'm not going to go into details about what they did to me here. All i'll say is that it changed the way i see this community.\r\n\r\nI could go on, but I don't want to give this sickening waste of time and money any more attention than they're already getting on here. Let's just hope whoever's reading this isn't paying these sex freaks their hard earned cash. \r\n\r\nWhat people do in their own dreams is totally fine, we all have sexual urges and needs. But don't try and make money out of it or force people to do things they don't want to do.","comments":{}}},"users":{"99electricsheep":{"bio":"Pay me in dream money ;)"},"BinTree00":{"bio":"meow! magnets taste so nice"},"HydeNSikh":{"bio":"“We are like the dreamer who dreams, and then lives inside the dream.”"},"resibomb":{"bio":"basically looking for new hardware and willing to trade/barter"},"ShuxWana":{"bio":"I'm not a fan-girl I'm a fan-WOMAN...alright i'm a fan-girl"},"TheSetiYeti":{"bio":"Communcation with aliens THIS CENTURY or we have failed as a species!"},"Trade61":{"bio":"When I get my resonator it's over for you people"},"user1009":{"bio":""}}}
